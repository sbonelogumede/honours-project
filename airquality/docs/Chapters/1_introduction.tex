\section{Introduction}
   
   In this paper we offer a basic introduction into time series analysis. The main focus is on using Gaussian process, for time series analysis. We then benchmark the performance of Gaussian processes to other time series models. An area of application included is predicting the level of air pollution in the Table View station in Cape Town for the year of 2019.
