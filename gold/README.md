# Gaussian Process Forecasting for Gold Prices

This repository contains the full implementation and supporting documentation for the financial application component of the *Honours Thesis on Gaussian Process Regression and Uncertainty Quantification*.  
The study focuses on forecasting **daily Gold ETF prices** using various **Gaussian Process (GP)** models and comparing their performance to traditional time-series benchmarks.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The goal of this project is to evaluate and enhance the predictive capability of Gaussian Process regression in a financial context.  
Three GP-based approaches were developed and compared against standard benchmark forecasting models:

1. **GP-Single:** Baseline model trained on the full dataset.  
2. **Bootstrap Ensemble GP:** Ensemble of GPs trained on bootstrapped samples to improve robustness and uncertainty calibration.  
3. **Cross-Validation (CV) Ensemble GP:** Aggregation of GPs trained on cross-validation folds.

Each model was assessed on **daily gold price data (2011â€“2019)** using multiple error metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE) and visual diagnostics.  
Benchmark comparisons include Mean, NaÃ¯ve, Seasonal NaÃ¯ve, Drift, and AR(1) models.
