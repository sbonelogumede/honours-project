1 Exploratory Data Analysis

We conduct a comprehensive exploratory analysis following methodologies similar to Dalais (2024), covering data quality, distributional checks, volatility clustering, and autocorrelation.
```{r}

library(skimr)        # enhanced summary statistics
library(corrplot)     # correlation plots
library(FinTS)        # ARCH tests
library(tseries)      # Jarque-Bera and stationarity tests
```

1.1 Summary Statistics and Missing values


```{r}
# Enhanced summary of numeric features
gold %>% select(Open, High, Low, Close, Adj.Close, Volume) %>% skim()

# Missing values per column
sapply(gold, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

# Missing trading dates
dates_full <- seq(min(gold$Date), max(gold$Date), by = "day")
missing_dates <- setdiff(dates_full, gold$Date)
length(missing_dates)
head(missing_dates)
```
