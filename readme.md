## Abstract

There are many ways to model the autocorrelation structure in time series data. Capturing the correlation structure through a Gaussian Process is a non-parametric approach which is very flexible and a good approach for capturing uncertainties. For this project we use Gaussian processes for modelling time series data, simulate from Gaussian processes, reproduce existing model fits to data, and then model a local data set using Gaussian processes.
